# FLUIDOS Model-Based Meta-Orchestrator

The project inroduces an intent-based meta-orchestrator for a geo-distributed continuum where an intent is an explicit or implicit resource request. The main idea is to consider the node orchestration problem as user-item engagement, like in recommendation system approach, to recommend an available resource (item) for the input intent (user).

The orchestrator is then called as a [Kubernetes operator](https://kopf.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) after [kubectl CLI](https://github.com/fluidos-project/kubectl-fluidos-plugin) extension run.
